# Learning Basic HTML Structure

The goal of this task was to learn how to:
- Write simple text content in HTML
- Use heading tags like <h1>, <h2>, and <h3>
- Wrap text inside paragraph tags <p>
- Understand the basic structure of a webpage

🧠 What I Learned
1. <h1> is used for the main heading of a page.
2. <h2> and <h3> represent subheadings for organizing content.
3. <p> is used to write paragraphs or descriptions.
4. HTML provides the structure and meaning to webpage content.
This was my first step toward understanding how real web pages are built!
