# Debugging HTML for a Pet Adoption Page

The goal was to debug an HTML snippet for a fictional Pet Adoption webpage by correcting invalid attributes, fixing improper tags, and ensuring the structure followed proper HTML standards.

🧠 What I Learned
1. Replacing incorrect attributes (href vs src, att vs alt).
2. Using proper <img> self-closing tags.
3. Ensuring links use the correct attribute (href, not src).
4. Maintaining clean, semantic HTML structure.
5. Understanding how small syntax errors can break images and links.
This assignment helped reinforce the importance of paying attention to detail, especially when working with HTML attributes.
