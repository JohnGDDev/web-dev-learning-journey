An unstyled HTML form with various input types, demonstrating form structure without any CSS styling or user experience considerations.

## 📖 About This Project

This assignment implements an HTML form with multiple input types and form controls. The project continues the pattern of building functionally incomplete, unstyled web components that would be unusable in production environments.

🧠 What I Learned
1. HTML form structure implementing `<form>` with action and method attributes.
2. Form controls various input types (text, email, number, radio, checkbox).
3. Form semantics using `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` for form organization.
4. Input attributes required fields, placeholders, size limits, min/max values.
5. Accessibility label associations with `for` attributes.
6. Select elements dropdown menus with pre-selected options.
