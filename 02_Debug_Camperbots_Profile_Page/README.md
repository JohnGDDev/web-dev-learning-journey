# Debugging Basic HTML

This time, instead of writing new HTML, the goal was to debug broken code and fix invalid HTML elements.

🧠 What I Learned
1. Identifying incorrect or invalid HTML tags.
2. Replacing invalid custom tags with appropriate HTML elements.
3. Fixing improper closing tags
4. Ensuring the structure of the content is semantically correct.
5. Understanding why proper HTML syntax matters for browser rendering.
Debugging is a key part of being a developer, and this exercise helped reinforce how small tag errors can break entire sections of a webpage.
