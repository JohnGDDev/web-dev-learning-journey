# Bookstore Page - HTML Assignment

A basic HTML webpage for a fictional bookstore, built as part of my full-stack development learning journey. This project introduces CSS class naming conventions while maintaining focus on HTML structure.

🧠 What I Learned
1. HTML structure building a multi-section webpage with proper semantic elements.
2. CSS class planning implementing class names for future styling (`card`, `btn`, `card-container`).
3. Component organization structuring reusable components (cards, buttons).
4. ID attributes using IDs for specific element targeting.
5. Content layout organizing content into logical sections and containers.
