# Cat Photo App - HTML Assignment

The goal was to build a basic webpage using proper HTML5 semantics and structure while including various HTML elements.

🧠 What I Learned
1. HTML document structure proper use of `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
2. Semantic HTML implementation of `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and `<figure>` for better accessibility and structure.
3. Content organization structuring content with appropriate heading hierarchy (`<h1>` to `<h3>`).
3. Media elements embedding images with alt text for accessibility.
4. Lists implementing both ordered (`<ol>`) and unordered (`<ul>`) lists.
5. Text formatting using `<strong>` and `<em>` for text emphasis
