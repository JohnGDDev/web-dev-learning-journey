# Web Development Learning Journey

Welcome to my journey of becoming a Full Stack Developer!  
I’m documenting everything I learn — from HTML and CSS to JavaScript and backend development.

## 📘 Sections
1. **HTML** – Structure, elements, and semantic tags  
2. **CSS** – Styling, layouts, and responsive design  
3. **JavaScript** – Logic and interactivity (coming soon)

## 🎯 Goals
- Build consistency by coding every week  
- Track my progress publicly  
- Receive feedback and improve my skills
